# Express Session RethinkDB

RethinkDB session store for Express 4.x

## Installation

```
npm install express-session-rethinkdb --save
```

## Getting started

Note that you must already have Express Session already installed (`npm install express-session --save`). Also this specific package uses `rethinkdbdash` driver which has more advanced features.
*See [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash)*

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var cookie = require('cookie-parser');
var session = require('express-session');
var RDBStore = require('express-session-rethinkdb')(session);

var app = express();
var rdbStore = new RDBStore({
  connectOptions: {
    servers: [
      { host: '192.168.0.100', port: 28015 },
      { host: '192.168.0.101', port: 28015 },
      { host: '192.168.0.102', port: 28015 }
    ],
    db: 'test',
    discovery: false,
    pool: false,
    buffer: 50,
    max: 1000,
    timeout: 20,
    timeoutError: 1000
  },
  table: 'session',
  sessionTimeout: 86400000,
  flushInterval: 60000,
  debug: false
});

app.use(cookie());
app.use(session({
  key: 'sid',
  secret: 'my5uperSEC537(key)!',
  cookie: { maxAge: 860000 },
  store: rdbStore
}));

// the rest of your server code..
```

##Constructor options

###connectOptions
Options for connecting to the database server.
*See [RethinkDB's doc](http://www.rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/#connect)*
*Also see [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash)*

###table
Name of the table in which session data will be stored.
`Default: 'session'`

###sessionTimeout
If you do not set ```cookie.maxAge``` in ```session``` middleware, sessions will last until the user closes their browser.
However we cannot keep the session data infinitely (for size and security reasons).
In this case, this setting defines the maximum length of a session, even if the user does not close their browser.
`Default: 86400000` *1 day*

###flushInterval
RethinkDB does not yet provide an expiration function ( like ```SETEX``` for Redis ), so we have to remove the old expired sessions from the database intermittently. This is the time interval in milliseconds between flushing of expired sessions.
`Default: 60000` *60 seconds*

###debug
If debug is enabled, this middleware will start using console.log() to print debug type messages for session get, set, and destroy. These are currently mostly geared toward the memory caching. It takes a ```true``` or ```false``` value. `Default: false`
